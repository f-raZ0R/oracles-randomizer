# oracles-randomizer `asm/` notes

The file format is:

```
common:
  bank/(address/)?label: code
  ...
floating:
  label: code
  ...
text:
  label: text
  ...
agestext:
  label: text
  ...
seasonstext:
  label: text
  ...
seasons:
  bank/(address/)?label: code
  ...
ages:
  bank/(address/)?label: code
  ...
```

- `common` code is used in both games.
- `floating` code is defined but not given a bank or address.
- `text` behaves like `floating` but is interpreted as text, similar to
  romdata/text.yaml.
- `agestext` and `seasonstext` define text for the respective games.
- `seasons` and `ages` code only apply to the respective games.

Any of the sections can be omitted.

- A key of the form `02/openRingList` means that the label `openRingList` will
  be attached to its translated value, which will be appended to bank `02`. If
  the label starts with `dma_`, the address will be aligned with the next
  $10-byte block so that it can be DMA transferred accurately.
- A key of the form `02/56a1/` will overwrite the data at `02:56a1` with its
  translated value. Its label is empty, so it is "anonymous" and cannot be
  referenced by other code. Non-empty labels are also allowed, as in
  `01/7e63/spoolSwampSeason`.
- A key of the form `removeGashaNutRingText` means that the entire string is a
  label attached to its untranslated value, which is not assigned a location in
  the ROM. Another item can `/include removeGashaNutRingText` in order to use
  that value at a specific address. This type of key is only allowed in the
  `floating` section, and it is the only kind of key that can appear in that
  section.

YAML does not really care how much indentation happens as long as it happens at
all. In most cases I indent by two spaces, but I indent blocks of code by four
for readability.

You can use e.g. `-devcmd findaddr seasons/02/76f2` to find out what label or
substitution (if any) is at a given address, and e.g. `-devcmd showasm
seasons/treeWarp` to show the location and disassembly of a given label. This
does not work (or account) for tables not generated until randomization.

The code itself is translated by [lgbtasm](https://github.com/jangler/lgbtasm).
