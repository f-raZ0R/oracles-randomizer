# Seasons Hard Logic Strategy Guide

This document details tricks and obscurities that are in Seasons hard logic.
See
[seasons_notes.md](https://github.com/jangler/oracles-randomizer/blob/doc/seasons_notes.md)
for a list of things that are out of logic even in hard.

## General

- Use mystery seeds to light torches (1 in 4 chance of success). This is only
  in logic for rooms with no more than 2 torches.
- Get various types of seeds from sources other than trees:
	- Pegasus seeds from Subrosia Market (requires shield)
	- Ember seeds from the plants in Agunima's room in D4
	- Ember seeds from the Armos puzzle chest in D5
	- Ember seeds from the plants in the first Poe Sister's room in D7
	- Mystery seeds from Frypolar's room in D8
- Get bombs from the plants in D2.
- Use bomb boosts to increase jump distance. Pull a bomb near the gap you're
  jumping, move slightly closer to the gap, and jump in the desired direction
  as the bomb explodes. Buffering the simultaneous jump + directional input by
  holding the relevant buttons while closing a menu makes the trick easier.

  Strictly horizontal and vertical bomb jumps include:
	- Lava between Mt. Cucco portal and Subrosia Market
	- Water between D5 entrance and minecart room
	- Lava before cave entrance in Temple Remains
	- Water in Sunken City diving cave
	- Water in cave under Floodgate Keeper's House
	- Lava in Goron Mountain cave
	- Water in Goron Mountain cave
	- Lava between north & south Subrosia
	- Lava in Subrosia on Temple Remains portal screen

  Specific multi-directional bomb jumps are detailed later in this document,
  with video examples.

## Overworld

- RNG manip 100-rupee drops using the shovel, for infinite rupees in logic.
  Hard reset, mash through the title screen (it rolls RNG every frame), make 7
  screen transitions, and dig until the 100-rupee drop. Make sure not to delay
  the dig after the Rope, since the Rope also rolls RNG periodically.

- Cucco clip: reach the cave below the Spring Banana tree by grabbing the Cucco
  through the corner â€“ move straight right into the rock before the screen
  transition so that the rock pushes you downward. This only matters if you
  have gale seeds to warp out.
