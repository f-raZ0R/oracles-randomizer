# oracles-randomizer multiworld

The randomizer can generate interconnected seeds that can be played
simultaneously with other players on BizHawk. Each player's items are
distributed across all the files generated by a single seed, and a player's
items that are not in their own game are sent to them via the network.

1. Follow the BizHawk Co-op Netplay setup instructions at
   https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/bizhawk-co-op#Setup
2. Place Oracles.lua in the bizhawk-co-op/ramcontroller/ folder
3. Generate a seed using the command line. A valid invocation looks like:
   `oracles-randomizer.exe -multi s,a+t,s+hdp`, run in the directory containing
   your vanilla ROMs.
4. Follow the rest of the instructions in the bizhawk-co-op readme to play the
   game.

Notes and limitations:

- Up to 99 players for a single seed are supported.
- Seasons files can't contain Ages-exclusive items even if those items go to
  other players, and vice versa.
- Rings and shops, as well as a select few other checks, will always belong to
  the local player.
- The treasure map in Seasons only displays the locations of your own jewels.
  Jewels that aren't in your game have sparkles at the Tarm gate instead.
- Finishing a multiworld game (i.e. defeating Onox or Veran) doesn't set
  postgame flags, since they would make some checks inaccessible.
- Multiworld plandos aren't a thing.
- Multiworld linked games are not supported.
